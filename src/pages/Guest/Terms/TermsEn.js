            forum, and changes to other material and substantive portions of

            ARBITRATION NOTICE: Section 16 (Arbitration Agreement and Waiver of
            Certain Rights) of these Terms contains provisions governing how

            against us only on an individual basis, not as a plaintiff or class
            member in any class or representative action or proceeding; and (2)
            you waive your right to seek relief in a court of law and to have a
            jury trial on your claims.

            interaction with, between, and among you, Content Creator Users,
            Recipients (as defined herein), and Nejma (along with its employees,
            agents, interns, and contractors)) performed hereunder (or under any
            implied direct contract between the User and You) shall be subject
            to the Nejma Community Guidelines (as the same may be amended from

            you for review by written request to legal@nejma.co), which are

            invented (for example, on social media platforms).
          </p>
          <p >
            e. Nejma Videos are licensed and are not sold. You may not sell,
            re-sell, or encumber your rights in any Nejma Video. You may
            sublicense your rights in a Nejma Video only to the extent necessary
            for you to use the Nejma Video as permitted under these Terms (for
            example, sharing it with friends on a social media platform, sending
            it to a Recipient for personal, non-commercial, and non-promotional
            purposes subject to these Terms).

            notice to you.
          </p>
          <p >
            g. You may not use a Nejma Video to promote a business without
            further written agreement and financial consideration negotiated by
            and among you, Nejma, and the Content Creator User. If you are found
            to violate this provision, whether intentionally or not, you will be
            liable to pay, at minimum, a financial penalty equal to Ten Thousand
            United States Dollars (US$10,000) multiplied by each confirmed
            unauthorized use of a Nejma Video for purposes in violation of these
            Terms exclusive of, and in addition to, any other damages determined
            by a court of law in accordance herewith. Your rights to use the
            Site will be immediately suspended, and your rights to use the Site
            going forward shall be subject to Nejma's right to immediate
            termination (without prejudice to Nejma's, or the Content Creator
            User's, further rights and remedies at law or under these Terms.).

            (defined below) you make, and that you will not make any request or
            Submission that infringes on the privacy or other rights of a third
            party. You acknowledge that the Nejma watermark on each Nejma Video
            must remain intact and you agree not to edit, change, modify, or

            or create any derivative work of a Nejma Video or assist or
            encourage any third party to do so. If you breach any provisions of
            these Terms, your license to use the Nejma Video granted under
            Clause 1(d) terminates, and you must promptly remove all copies of
            the Nejma Video in your possession or control, including on any
            social media platform, notify any Recipient of the termination and
            need to remove all copies, and take any other action we reasonably
            request to assist in locating and removing the Nejma Video,
            including identifying each Recipient.

            based upon contract, warranty, tort (including negligence), strict
            liability or otherwise, and whether or not Nejma has been advised of
            the possibility of such damages.
          </p>
          <p >
            f. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, our total

          </p>
          <p >
            g. Certain jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of
            certain damages. If those laws apply to you, some or all of the

          <p >
            b. Nejma will have the sole right to select counsel to be paid for
            by you in connection with any indemnification owed by you. You will
            reasonably cooperate with us in connection with this indemnification
            and any defense.
          </p>
          <p >
            16. Arbitration Agreement and Waiver of Certain Rights
          </p>
          <p >
            a. Arbitration: You and Nejma agree to resolve any disputes between
            you and Nejma through binding and final arbitration instead of
            through court proceedings. You and Nejma each hereby waive any right
            to a jury trial of any controversy, claim, counterclaim, or other
            dispute arising between you and Nejma relating to these Terms or our
            Site (each a "Claim," and collectively, "Claims"). Any Claim will be
            submitted for binding arbitration in accordance with the Rules of
            the American Arbitration Association ("AAA Rules"). The arbitration
            will be heard and determined by a single arbitrator. The
            arbitrator's decision will be in writing, will include the
            arbitrator's reasons for the decision, will be final and binding
            upon the parties, and may be enforced in any court of competent
            jurisdiction. The parties agree that the arbitration will be kept
            confidential and that the existence of the proceeding and any
            element of it (including any pleadings, briefs, or other documents
            submitted or exchanged, any testimony or other oral submissions, and
            awards) will not be disclosed beyond the arbitration proceedings,
            except as may lawfully be required in judicial proceedings relating
            to the arbitration or by applicable disclosure rules and regulations
            of securities regulatory authorities or other governmental agencies.
          </p>
          <p >
            b. No Preclusions: This arbitration agreement does not preclude you
            or Nejma from seeking action by federal, state, or local government
            agencies. You and Nejma each also have the right to bring any
            qualifying Claim in small claims court. In addition, you and Nejma
            each retain the right to apply to any court of competent
            jurisdiction for provisional relief, including pre-arbitral
            attachments or preliminary injunctions, and any such request will
            not be deemed to be either incompatible with these Terms or a waiver
            of the right to have disputes submitted to arbitration as provided
            in these Terms.
          </p>
          <p >
            c. No Class Representative or Private Attorney General: You and
            Nejma each agree that neither may act as a class representative or
            private attorney general or participate as a member of a class of
            claimants, with respect to any Claim. You agree that Claims may not
            be arbitrated on a class or representative basis. The arbitrator can
            decide only individual Claims (whether brought by you or Nejma). The
            arbitrator may not consolidate or join the claims of other persons
            or parties who may be similarly situated.
          </p>
          <p >
            d. Severability/No Waiver/Survival: If any provision of this Section
            16 (Arbitration Agreement and Waiver of Certain Rights) is found to
            be invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be deemed
            appropriately modified to give effect to the intent of the provision
            or, if modification is not possible, will be severed and the
            remainder of this Section 16 (Arbitration Agreement and Waiver of
            Certain Rights) will continue in full force and effect. No waiver of
            any provision of this Section 16 (Arbitration Agreement and Waiver
            of Certain Rights) will be effective or enforceable unless recorded
            in a writing signed by the party waiving such a right or
            requirement. Such a waiver will not waive or affect any other
            provision of these Terms. This Section 16 (Arbitration Agreement and
            Waiver of Certain Rights) of these Terms will survive the
            termination of your relationship with Nejma.
          </p>
          <p >
            e. 30-Day Opt-Out Right. You have the right to opt out of the
            provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by sending, within thirty
            (30) days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration
            Agreement, written notice of your decision to opt to the following
            addresses: Nejma Inc., Attention: Legal Department, 251 Little Falls
            Drive, Wilmington, New Castle County, DE 19808. Your notice must
            include your name and address, any usernames, each email address you
            have used to submit your Nejma Video requests or set up an account
            on our Site (if applicable), and an unequivocal statement that you
            want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. You agree that if you
            opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of these
            Terms will continue to apply to you. Opting out of this Arbitration
            Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you
            may currently have, or may enter in the future, with us.
          </p>
          <p >
            f. LIMITATIONS: This Section 16 (Arbitration Agreement and Waiver of
            Certain Rights) limits certain rights, including the right to
            maintain certain court actions, the right to a jury trial, the right
            to participate in any form of class or representative claim, the
            right to engage in discovery except as provided in AAA rules, and
            the right to certain remedies and forms of relief. In addition,
            other rights that you or Nejma would have in court may not be
            available in arbitration.
          </p>
          <h2>17. Other Provisions</h2>
          <p >
            a. Force Majeure: Under no circumstances will any Nejma Party be
            liable for any delay or failure in performance due in whole or in
            part to any acts of God, earthquakes, unavoidable accidents, laws,
            rules, regulations or orders of government authorities, acts of war
            (declared or not), terrorism, hostilities, pandemic/epidemic (or
            other major health emergency as declared by the World Health
            Organization or applicable local authorities), blockades, civil
            disturbances, embargoes, strikes, or any other event or cause beyond
            the reasonable control of any Nejma Party.
          </p>
          <p >
            b. Choice of Law and Jurisdiction: These Terms will be governed by
            and construed in accordance with the laws and regulations of the
            State of Delaware, without giving effect to any conflict of laws
            rules or provisions. You agree that any action of whatever nature
            arising from or relating to these Terms or our Site that is filed
            consistent with Section 16 (Arbitration Agreement and Waiver of
            Certain Rights), will be filed only in the state or federal courts
            located in Wilmington, Delaware. You consent and submit to the
            personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of any such
            action.
          </p>
          <p >
            c. Severability: If any provision of these Terms is found to be
            invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be deemed
            appropriately modified to give effect to the intent of the provision
            or, if modification is not possible, will be severed from these
            Terms and will not affect the enforceability of any other provision.
          </p>
          <p >
            d. No Waiver or Amendment: The failure by Nejma to enforce any right
            or provision of these Terms will not prevent Nejma from enforcing
            such right or provision in the future and will not be deemed to
            modify these Terms.
          </p>
          <p >
            e. Assignment: Nejma may, at any time, assign its rights and
            obligations under these Terms, including in connection with a sale
            of assets, merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, other
            transaction, or by operation of law.
          </p>
          <p >
            f. Miscellaneous: The term "including" in these Terms will be
            interpreted broadly and will mean "including, without limitation."
            Titles are for convenience only and will not be considered when
            interpreting these Terms.

          <p >
            a. From time to time, we may change these Terms. If we change these
            Terms, we will give you written notice by electronic means (and only
            as and when required by applicable law) and by posting the revised
            Terms on our Site and updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of
            these Terms.
          </p>
          <p >
            b. The revised Terms will be effective immediately if you are a new
            user of our Site and will be effective seven (7) days after posting
            if you are an existing registered user unless you accept the revised

            in laws/regulations (such as the imposition of a new tariff, tax,
            etc.) or economic conditions (such as a financial recession), has,
            or may have, a substantial effect on the cost of Nejma Services as
            determined by Nejma in its sole discretion, then Nejma may change
            the terms and conditions of these Terms immediately and without
            notice you, including without limitation with respect to material
            terms such as any financial considerations specified herein. c. By
            continuing to use our Site, you agree to the revised Terms. Please
            print a copy of these Terms for your records and PLEASE check the

          <p >a. Nejma Videos:</p>
          <p >
            i. From time to time, a user of our Site (the "User") may request
            one (1) or more video/audio/content recordings (each, whether video,
            audio, or other format such as 3D or VR content, a "Nejma Video")
            from you through our Site. You will use commercially reasonable
            efforts to fulfill a request within no more than twenty-four (24)
            hours of receiving it, but you may have up to seven (7) calendar
            days (at Nejma's sole discretion) to complete and upload the Nejma
            Video. If you do not either: (i) accept the request and upload the
            Nejma Video; or (ii) decline the request within that time; the
            request will expire and can no longer be fulfilled (except that you
            may fulfill the expired request at no cost to the User and with no
            payment due from us). All actions (including without limitation
            interaction with, between, and among you, Users, Recipients (as
            defined herein), and Nejma (along with its employees, agents,
            interns, and contractors)) performed hereunder (or under any implied
            direct contract between the User and You) shall be subject to the
            Nejma Community Guidelines (as the same may be amended from time to
            time at Nejma's sole discretion and as is made available to you for
            review by written request to legal@nejma.co), which are incorporated
            by reference to the Terms.
          </p>
          <p >
            ii. As an independent contractor (under your contract directly with
            the User), you may decline a request, or otherwise refuse, in your
            discretion, to create or upload a Nejma Video for any legal reason
            provided such reason is not simultaneously a violation of Nejma's
            Community Guidelines. If you accept a request, you, as an
            independent contractor, will enter into a direct, implied contract
            with the User, which Nejma is not a party to under any circumstance.
            The implied contract solely between You and the User will include,
            by incorporation and reference, Nejma's Community Guidelines. If you
            accept, you agree to record and upload to our Site one Nejma Video
            (or, if responding to multiple simultaneous requests, multiple Nejma
            Videos, as the case may be). Nejma retains the right, in its sole
            discretion, to cancel any request from a User. We reserve the right
            to remove your Nejma Video at any time for any reason. No payment
            will be made to you for any declined, cancelled, or unfulfilled
            Nejma Video request. Each Nejma Video will be approximately between
            thirty seconds (0:30) and one minute (1:00) in duration and will
            follow the general directions and requests of the User (for example,
            birthday greetings).
          </p>
          <p >
            iii. You will have sole discretion over the script and content of
            any Nejma Video, except that you agree: (x) you will use your name /
            stage name (e.g. a personal introduction of yourself), the User's
            name, and, the name of any third party (or third party group or
            organization) that the User identifies as a recipient (each, a
            "Recipient", and collectively the "Recipients") in each Nejma Video,
            unless otherwise requested by the User; and (y) you will not state
            in the Nejma Video that the Nejma Video is incomplete or cannot be
            completed. Your response to the User's request is your
            responsibility and at your discretion, subject to these Terms. If
            you complete a Nejma Video but do not follow the general directions
            and requests of the User, or otherwise violate these Terms, we will
            discuss with you, and, when necessary, the User an appropriate
            adjustment, if any, to the payment initially owed to you by the User
            under your implied contract with the User. Your interactions with
            third parties, including Users, on or through our Site, are solely
            between you and the third party; however, Nejma may, in its sole
            discretion, intercede in order to try to resolve any dispute, and
            you will reasonably cooperate with Nejma if it does so. You
            acknowledge and agree that Nejma will not be responsible for any
            damages, losses, costs, expenses, or liabilities incurred as a
            result of such interactions. You agree to contact Users about Nejma
            Videos only through our Site.

            false information, on behalf of another person (except as outlined
            below for a parent or legal guardian and Organizations), or if you

            as of the last date these Terms were updated), and related services,
            such as delivery of the Nejma Video to the User, in connection with

          </p>
          <p >
            b. Nejma does not provide, or procure, the service of creating the
            Nejma Video to the User. The service of creating the Nejma Video is
            a service you provide directly to the User under an implied contract
            entered into directly between you and each User.
          </p>
          <p >
            c. The User may request additional features to be added to the Nejma
            Video, such as translations, subtitling, or additional edits (e.g.
            added graphics or text such as "Happy Birthday" and the name of the
            recipient in another language at the bottom of the message) to the
            Nejma Video, which Nejma may perform for you as an add-on to the
            Nejma Services provided to you. You will pay one hundred percent

            a. Fees Payable to You by the User: Other than with respect to an
            expired request that you choose to fulfill (as set forth in Clause
            1(a) (Nejma Videos)) and subject to these Terms, we, as your limited
            collection payment agent, will collect one hundred percent (100%) of
            the gross revenue owed to you from a User for each Nejma Video you
            create and deliver to fulfill such User's request that is accepted
            through our Site. We, or a third party payment processor, will remit
            to you all funds owed to you under your contract with each User.
            Prior to remitting payment to you, we will set off any monies owed
            to us by you for the Nejma Services (and, as the case may be, for
            payment of any third party costs, fees, and expenses that are not
            part of the Nejma Services, or are addon services). You will have
            the right to set your own price for each Nejma Video, provided,
            however, that your price must be at least U.S. $1 (unless otherwise
            agreed by Nejma). You represent and warrant that: (i) Nejma Videos
            are not, and are not intended to be, covered by any guild, union,
            collective bargaining, or similar agreement and there will be no
            residual or any other type of payment due from Nejma to you, to any
            third party, guild, or union, or pursuant to any collective
            bargaining agreement, in connection with any Nejma Video, payment
            from us to you, or our Site; (ii) Nejma is not responsible for, and
            will not make any deduction to payments made to you for any fees,
            commissions, costs, expenses, or payments of any kind to or with
            respect to any third party, including any manager, agent, attorney,

            earned by or payments made to you in connection with our Site; and
            (iii) Nejma is not responsible for any contributions, payments,
            taxes, or deductions for social insurance, retirement benefits,

          </p>
          <p >
            b. Fees Payable to Us by You: For the first twelve (12) months
            following your agreement to use the Nejma Services (such date as
            determined by Nejma in its sole, reasonable discretion), you will
            pay us twenty-five percent (25%) of gross revenue generated from
            your use of the Nejma App (excluding add-on services or third party
            pass-through costs, which will be paid one hundred percent (100%) to
            Nejma (e.g. the cost of translation services, payment processing
            fees, or other add-on features such as filters, which Nejma will
            execute on your behalf under our contract with you as a sub-set of
            the statement of work comprising the Nejma Services for any given
            Nejma Video)). Your payment to us shall constitute payment for the
            Nejma Services. The payment owed to us by you may be subject to
            additional taxes depending on the location where the Nejma Services
            are provided and your primary place of residence. For the avoidance
            of doubt, you understand, acknowledge, and agree that the
            percentage, or fee structure, for calculating the fee for Nejma
            Services may change after the first 12-month period lapses.
          </p>
          <p >
            c. Payment Processing: You agree to register with the third party
            payment provider selected by Nejma, which is currently stripe.com,
            or, if you live in a country in which stripe.com does not provide
            services or are an Organization, PayPal; any payment provider is
            subject to change in Nejma's sole discretion. You do not have the
            option to select a payment provider other than the one selected by
            Nejma. You agree to provide to the payment provider all information
            required by such payment provider in order to receive payments due
            via the payment provider. All payments will be in the currency you
            select with the payment provider. If you do not provide to the
            payment provider all required information, then you may not be able
            to receive the payments due to you. Nejma will not be responsible
            for any damages, losses, costs, expenses, or liabilities arising out
            of, or in connection with, your inability to receive payments as a
            result of your failure to provide such information. Subject to the
            applicable payment provider's terms, payment will be made to you by
            the payment provider within approximately two (2) weeks of receipt
            by Nejma of payment from the User for each request for a Nejma Video
            that you have fulfilled (as set forth in Clause 1(a) (Nejma
            Videos)). You acknowledge and agree that no payment provider used by
            Nejma is operated, owned or controlled by Nejma, and your use of any
            such payment provider is subject to the terms and conditions and
            privacy policies of that payment provider. We are not responsible
            for any delay, failure, damage, or liability caused by a payment
            provider, any other third party, a force majeure, or your failure to
            timely or properly set up an account with the payment provider or
            otherwise provide requested information for payment. Unless
            otherwise agreed by Nejma, you acknowledge and agree that you are
            solely responsible for any other fees, costs, and expenses incurred
            in connection with the use of a payment provider. Notwithstanding
            anything to the contrary contained in these Terms, if Nejma, in its
            sole discretion, believes that any fraud, money laundering, or other
            violation of law or regulation is taking place on or in connection
            with our Site, you acknowledge and agree that we may withhold,
            delay, or seek repayment of any payments we believe, in our sole
            discretion, may have arisen out of or in connection with any such
            violation of law or regulation.
          </p>

            d. Charities: If you identify any charitable entity on your booking
            page or identify your relationship with the charitable entity
            elsewhere on our Site (each, a "Charity"), you: (i) represent and
            warrant that you will comply with all applicable laws and
            regulations that arise as a result of that identification, including

            required agreement, such as co-venturer agreements; (ii) acknowledge
            and agree that we have the right in our sole discretion to reject

            within twenty-four (24) hours of your receipt of our request, you
            will provide us with written evidence of the Charity's good standing
            and charitable status in all applicable jurisdictions, and that you
            will promptly remove the identification if the Charity ceases to be
            in good standing; (iv) represent and warrant that you will be
            responsible for making any payment to the Charity (unless we
            expressly agree in writing in advance to do so on your behalf and in
            satisfaction of our payment obligations to you under these Terms);
            and (v) represent and warrant that you have all rights necessary to
            grant to us a license to use the name and logo of the Charity in
            connection with our Site, including on our Site, in your
            identification, and in any social and other media. Any Charity
            identified must comply with Nejma's Community Guidelines, and you
            agree that Nejma has the absolute right to reject any use of a
            Charity on the Site at its sole discretion. You further acknowledge
            and agree that we may add, in our sole discretion, to your booking
            page language similar to the following (subject to change in our
            sole discretion): "Nejma has no affiliation with, and does not
            endorse, [Charity]. Any payment or donation to [Charity] is the sole
            responsibility of [your name], and Nejma is not responsible or
            liable for same. Only [your name]'s portion of the fee paid to Nejma
            for a Nejma Video will be donated to [Charity]." If you choose to
            participate in a promotion conducted by Nejma that involves a
            charitable entity, Additional Terms may apply.
          </p>
          <p >
            e. Content Creator Referral Program: Under Nejma's referral program,
            we offer you and others who register on our Site as a content
            creator referral source ("Nejma Partner") the opportunity to provide
            their friends, families, or other personal contacts with a unique
            referral code we provide to you ("Code") that a prospective content
            creator can use to register with Nejma to begin creating Nejma
            Videos under a direct implied contract with Users using the Nejma
            Services accessed through the Site (the "Referral Program"). To
            participate in the Referral Program, you must agree to the following
            Referral Program Terms and Conditions ("Referral Terms"), as well as
            the remainder of these Terms:

          <p >
            i. Nejma reserves the right to suspend or terminate the Referral
            Program or your ability to participate in the Referral Program at
            any time for any reason. Without limiting the foregoing rights, we
            reserve the right to disqualify you from participating in the
            Referral Program at any time at our sole discretion if you fail to
            comply with these Referral Terms. Violations of these Referral Terms
            may also result in the forfeiture of all Referral Fees (defined
            below), you previously earned through the Referral Program. We
            reserve the right to review and investigate activities undertaken in
            connection with the Referral Program and to suspend your Site
            account or modify the consideration (e.g. the Referral Fee), in our
            sole discretion, as we deem fair and appropriate, including for
            actions that are legal but otherwise circumvent the intent and
            spirit of the Referral Program.
          </p>
          <p >
            ii. Eligibility to participate in this Referral Program is limited
            to individuals who have registered an account on our Site as a
            Content Creator User or Nejma Partner and agree to these Terms. This
            Referral Program cannot be used by businesses for affiliate lead
            generation or other commercial purposes. Employees, officers,
            directors, contractors, agents, interns, and representatives of
            Nejma are not eligible to participate in the Referral Program.
            Registered Organizations, and any employees, officers, directors,
            contractors, agents, interns, and representatives of registered

            iii. For every new user who registers as a new content creator on
            our Site using your Code ("Referred Content Creator"), for six (6)
            months, beginning on the date that the Referred Content Creator
            initiates onboarding as a new content creator on our Site using your
            Code, we will pay to you twelve percent (12%) of the revenue owed to
            Nejma for the Nejma Services that is generated by such Content
            Creator User for each Nejma Video the Referred Content Creator
            created and delivered to fulfill a User's request accepted through
            our Site (the "Referral Fee"). The foregoing notwithstanding, the
            Referral Fee, and any calculations derived thereof, shall exclude
            third party costs (payment processing services, etc.); add-on
            services (translations, filters, etc.) that are a portion of the
            Nejma Services; tips (if applicable); Nejma Videos for which no
            revenue was earned; and, at Nejma's discretion, Nejma Videos to
            which a promotion applies or for which a promo code was used. The
            Referral Fee is based on revenue paid to Nejma for the Nejma
            Services only and is paid only from Nejma's net share of the revenue
            (as described in Section 3 (Fees and Payment) above and elsewhere
            through these Terms). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
            contained in these Terms, you acknowledge and agree that if the new
            user you referred fails to use your Code when registering, has
            previously registered on our Site (with another code, under another
            name, or otherwise), or has previously begun the on-boarding process
            for our Site, or if anyone else has received or is receiving a
            Referral Fee from us in connection with that new user, we will not
            pay, nor do we owe, any Referral Fee, payment, or credit to you or
            your Site account. You further acknowledge and agree that each
            Referred Content Creator may have one, and only one, lifetime
            referring person or entity, and that we are not obligated to pay a
            Referral Fee to more than one referring person or entity with
            respect to any Referred Content Creator. All of the foregoing,
            including calculation of the Referral Fee, is determined by Nejma in
            its sole discretion, and your use, or continued use, of the Site is
            dependent on your absolute and unconditional acceptance of the
            foregoing.
          </p>
          <p >
            iv. This Referral Program may be used only for personal purposes and
            you may share your Code only with your personal connections. You may
            not advertise your Code or share it with anyone other than your
            friends, family, or other personal contacts (for example, you may
            not share it on a social media channel). We reserve the right to
            revoke or refuse to issue any Referral Fees for Referred Content
            Creator that we suspect were generated through improper channels or
            otherwise in violation of these Referral Terms. Nejma, in its sole,
            reasonable discretion, shall determine the authenticity and veracity
            of a referral through the Referral Program, including
            disqualification of any referral and reimbursement to Nejma of any
            Referral Fees that were paid for referrals that should not have
            qualified or were otherwise deemed ineligible by Nejma in its sole
            discretion.
          </p>
          <p >
            v. You represent and warrant that any messages you use to share your
            Code with your personal connections will: be created and distributed
            in a personal manner; not be distributed in a bulk manner; and not
            be an unsolicited commercial email or a "spam" message under any
            applicable law or regulation. Any messages that do not meet these
            requirements are expressly prohibited and constitute grounds for
            immediate suspension and/or termination of your Site account and
            participation in this Referral Program. Registrations on our Site by
            a Content Creator User using a Code that was distributed through an
            unauthorized channel will not be valid and any Referral Fees issued
            in connection with such transactions may be revoked.
          </p>
          <p >
            vi. We reserve the right to deactivate your Site account and any
            Referred Content Creator's Site account, cancel all related Referral
            Fees, and seek repayment if we determine, in our sole discretion,
            that either you or the Referred Content Creator: (A) has tampered
            with this Referral Program; (B) has used (or attempted to use) this
            Referral Program in a fraudulent, abusive, unethical, or otherwise
            questionable or suspicious manner; (C) has breached any of these
            Referral Terms; or (D) has violated any law or regulation or
            infringed or violated the rights of any third party. We also reserve
            the right to cancel this Referral Program or change these Referral
            Terms at any time and for any reason in our sole discretion.
          </p>
          <p >
            vii. By participating in the Referral Program, you agree to release
            and hold harmless Nejma Parties from any and all economic
            liabilities, claims, damages, loss, harm, costs or expenses,
            including property damage, that arise from or relate in any way to
            the Referral Program. THIS PARAGRAPH 3(e)(vii) APPLIES ONLY TO
            ECONOMIC DAMAGES AND DOES NOT APPLY TO CLAIMS OF FRAUD OR PERSONAL
            INJURY.

          <p >
            g. You will use your own equipment to perform your obligations under
            these Terms and under any implied contract between you and any User
            for the production of a Nejma Video. You are solely responsible for
            making any disclosure required by any applicable law, regulation,
            court order or any agreement you may have with any third parties to
            any person or entity regarding your performance under these Terms.
          </p>
          <p >
            h. Your relationship with Nejma is non-exclusive, meaning that you
            can provide similar services to third parties and that we can, and
            do, engage third parties to provide similar services to those
            contemplated by these Terms.
          </p>
          <p >13. Nature of Relationship Between You and Each User</p>
          <p >
            a. You are using the Site and Nejma Services to source users so that
            you can independently and directly contract with each such User to
            provide services connected with the creation of a Nejma Video. For
            the absolute avoidance of doubt, you understand, agree, and
            acknowledge that Nejma, and any of its affiliates (now existing
            and/or hereafter created and/or acquired), is not a party to any
            such independent, direct contract between you and each User whether
            such contract is implied, oral, or reduced to a written instrument.
          </p>
          <p >
            b. For the absolute avoidance of doubt, any implied contract, and
            any reference to an implied contract herein, between you and a User
            may be reduced to a written instrument between you and such User
            directly and independently for the production of a Nejma Video by
            the Content Creator User provided such written agreement is: (i)
            lawful under applicable laws and regulations; (ii) does not
            otherwise contravene, circumvent, or otherwise make impossible any
            obligations, or responsibilities, that the User or the Content
            Creator User may have to Nejma under its separate agreement(s) with
            Nejma; and (iii) voluntarily includes the Nejma Community
            Guidelines.
          </p>
          <p >
            c. Any such implied and/or written agreement shall be independent
            from:
          </p>
          <p >
            i. any agreement(s) (written or otherwise) entered into by the User
            and Nejma related to the use and continued use of the Site;
          </p>
          <p >
            ii. any agreement(s) (written or otherwise) entered into by the
            Content Creator User and Nejma related to the use and continued use
            of the Site; and
          </p>
          <p >
            iii. the obligations and responsibilities that the User and Content
            Creator User have to comply with applicable laws and regulations.

          </p>
          <p >
            c. You acknowledge and agree that any material or information
            downloaded or otherwise obtained through our Site, including a User
            request, is done at your own risk and that you will be solely
            responsible for any damages, losses, costs, expenses, or liabilities

          <p >
            d. You acknowledge and agree that when using our Site, you will be
            exposed to content from a variety of sources, and that Nejma is not
            responsible for the accuracy, usefulness, safety, legality, or
            intellectual property rights of or relating to any such content. You
            further understand and acknowledge that you may be exposed to
            content that is inaccurate, offensive, indecent, objectionable, or
            harassing, and you agree to waive, and hereby do waive, any legal or
            equitable rights or remedies you have or may have against any Nejma
            Party with respect thereto.
          </p>
          <p >
            e. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you
            acknowledge and agree that in no event will any Nejma Party be
            liable to you or to any third party for any indirect, special,
            incidental, punitive, or consequential damages (including for loss
            of profits, revenue, or data) or for the cost of obtaining
            substitute products, arising out of or in connection with these
            Terms, however caused, whether such liability arises from any claim
            based upon contract, warranty, tort (including negligence), strict
            liability or otherwise, and whether or not Nejma has been advised of
            the possibility of such damages.
          </p>
          <p >
            f. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, our total
            cumulative liability to you or any third party under these Terms,
            from all causes of action and all theories of liability, will be
            limited to and will not exceed the fees actually received by Nejma
            from you during the twelve (12) months preceding the claim giving
            rise to such liability.
          </p>
          <p >
            g. Certain jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of
            certain damages. If those laws apply to you, some or all of the
            above exclusions or limitations may not apply to you, and you might
            have additional rights.
          </p>
          <p >
            h. You agree that the limitations of damages set forth above are
            fundamental elements of the basis of the bargain between Nejma and
            you.

          </p>
          <p >
            18. Arbitration Agreement and Waiver of Certain Rights
          </p>
          <p >
            a. Arbitration: You and Nejma agree to resolve any disputes between
            you and Nejma through binding and final arbitration instead of
            through court proceedings. You and Nejma each hereby waive any right
            to a jury trial of any controversy, claim, counterclaim, or other
            dispute arising between you and Nejma relating to these Terms or our
            Site (each a "Claim," and collectively, "Claims"). Any Claim will be
            submitted for binding arbitration in accordance with the Rules of
            the American Arbitration Association ("AAA Rules"). The arbitration
            will be heard and determined by a single arbitrator. The
            arbitrator's decision will be in writing, will include the
            arbitrator's reasons for the decision, will be final and binding
            upon the parties, and may be enforced in any court of competent
            jurisdiction. The arbitration and all proceedings will be conducted
            exclusively in the English language. The parties agree that the
            arbitration will be kept confidential and that the existence of the
            proceeding and any element of it (including any pleadings, briefs or
            other documents submitted or exchanged, any testimony or other oral
            submissions, and awards) will not be disclosed beyond the
            arbitration proceedings, except as may lawfully be required in
            judicial proceedings relating to the arbitration or by applicable
            disclosure rules and regulations of securities regulatory
            authorities or other governmental agencies.
          </p>
          <p >
            b. No Preclusions: This arbitration agreement does not preclude you
            or Nejma from seeking action by federal, state, or local government
            agencies. You and Nejma each also have the right to bring any
            qualifying Claim in small claims court. In addition, you and Nejma
            each retain the right to apply to any court of competent
            jurisdiction for provisional relief, including pre-arbitral
            attachments or preliminary injunctions, and any such request will
            not be deemed to be either incompatible with these Terms or a waiver
            of the right to have disputes submitted to arbitration as provided
            in these Terms. c. No Class Representative or Private Attorney
            General: You and Nejma each agree that neither may act as a class
            representative or private attorney general or participate as a
            member of a class of claimants, with respect to any Claim. You agree
            that Claims may not be arbitrated on a class or representative
            basis. The arbitrator can decide only individual Claims (whether
            brought by you or Nejma). The arbitrator may not consolidate or join
            the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly
            situated.
          </p>
          <p >
            d. Severability/No Waiver/Survival: If any provision of this Section
            18 (Arbitration Agreement and Waiver of Certain Rights) is found to
            be invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be deemed
            appropriately modified to give effect to the intent of the provision
            or, if modification is not possible, will be severed and the
            remainder of this Section 18 (Arbitration Agreement and Waiver of
            Certain Rights) will continue in full force and effect. No waiver of
            any provision of this Section 18 (Arbitration Agreement and Waiver
            of Certain Rights) will be effective or enforceable unless recorded
            in a writing signed by the party waiving such a right or
            requirement. Such a waiver will not waive or affect any other
            provision of these Terms. This Section 18 (Arbitration Agreement and
            Waiver of Certain Rights) of these Terms will survive the
            termination of your relationship with Nejma. e. 30-Day Opt-Out
            Right: You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this
            Arbitration Agreement by sending, within thirty (30) days after
            first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement, written notice
            of your decision to opt out to the following address: Nejma Inc.,
            c/o Legal Department, 251 Little Falls Drive, Wilmington, New Castle
            County, DE 19808. Your notice must include your name and address,
            any usernames, each email address you have used to set up an account
            on our Site, and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out
            of this Arbitration Agreement. You agree that if you opt out of this
            Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of these Terms will continue
            to apply to you. Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no
            effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently
            have, or may enter in the future, with us.
          </p>
          <p >
            f. LIMITATIONS: This Section 18 (Arbitration Agreement and Waiver of
            Certain Rights) limits certain rights, including the right to
            maintain certain court actions, the right to a jury trial, the right
            to participate in any form of class or representative claim, the
            right to engage in discovery except as provided in AAA rules, and
            the right to certain remedies and forms of relief. In addition,
            other rights that you or Nejma would have in court may not be
            available in arbitration.
          </p>
          <p >19. Other Provisions</p>
          <p >
            a. Force Majeure: Under no circumstances will any Nejma Party be
            liable for any delay or failure in performance due in whole or in
            part to any acts of God, earthquakes, unavoidable accidents, laws,
            rules, regulations or orders of government authorities, acts of war
            (declared or not), terrorism, hostilities, pandemic/epidemic (or
            other major health emergency as declared by the World Health
            Organization or applicable local authorities), blockades, civil
            disturbances, embargoes, strikes, or any other event or cause beyond
            the reasonable control of any Nejma Party.
          </p>
          <p >
            b. Choice of Law and Jurisdiction: These Terms will be governed by
            and construed in accordance with the laws and regulations of the
            State of Delaware, without giving effect to any conflict of laws
            rules or provisions. You agree that any action of whatever nature
            arising from or relating to these Terms or our Site that is filed
            consistent with Section 18 (Arbitration Agreement and Waiver of
            Certain Rights), will be filed only in the state or federal courts
            located in Wilmington, Delaware. You consent and submit to the
            personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of any such
            action.
          </p>
          <p >
            c. Severability: If any provision of these Terms is found to be
            invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be deemed
            appropriately modified to give effect to the intent of the provision
            or, if modification is not possible, will be severed from these
            Terms and will not affect the enforceability of any other provision.
          </p>
          <p >
            d. No Waiver or Amendment: The failure by Nejma to enforce any right
            or provision of these Terms will not prevent Nejma from enforcing
            such right or provision in the future and will not be deemed to
            modify these Terms.
          </p>
          <p >
            e. Assignment: Nejma may, at any time, assign its rights and
            obligations under these Terms, including in connection with a sale
            of assets, merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, other
            transaction, or by operation of law.
          </p>
          <p >
            f. Miscellaneous: The term "including" in these Terms will be
            interpreted broadly and will mean "including, without limitation."
            Titles are for convenience only and will not be considered when
            interpreting these Terms.
          </p>
          <p >20. Changes to these Terms</p>
          <p >
            a. From time to time, we may change these Terms. If we change these
            Terms, we will give you written notice by electronic means (and only
            as and when required by applicable law) and by posting the revised
            Terms on our Site and updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of
            these Terms.
          </p>
          <p >
            b. The revised Terms will be effective immediately if you are a new

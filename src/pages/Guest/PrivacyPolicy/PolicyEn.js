            significant dates (such as birthdays or anniversaries), and may
            permit you to do so through the use of our platform. If you use the
            Platforms to send a video or any other content, we collect certain
            Personal Information about the recipient (such as name, mailing
            address,and email address, as applicable). We may share the
            information regarding your transaction with third parties as
            necessary to process your transaction (i.e., to create, send or

          <p>
            We may receive information about you from third parties. For

            information from Nejma, the other website will forward your contact
            and other information to us so that we may contact you as requested.
            Further, we may receive certain information about you from third
            parties if you engage the third parties in connection with
            ourPlatforms – for example, if you download one of our Apps from an

            make a payment using a third-party payment provider likePayPal,
            consistent with the privacy policies of the applicable third
            parties.
          </p>
          <p>
            We also may supplement the information we collect with outside
            records from third parties in order to provide you with information,
            services or goods you have requested, to enhance our ability to
            serve you, and to tailor our content to you. We may combine the
            information we receive from those other sources with information we
            collect through the Platforms. In those cases, we will apply this
            PrivacyNotice to the combined information.
